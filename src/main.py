This script is mainly for things like burning your spotify playlists to cds for use in systems without bluetooth or spotify
a quick note before the script runs:
          
          1. Please ensure your spotify playlist is public so the script can see it and fetch the tracklist
          2. these playlists are usually very compressed by spotify so may seem smaller when downloaded via them, ensure you have plenty
          of space free on your drive and multiple cds if you plan on burning it
          3. This script requires you to create your own developer app on spotify for developers, can be found at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
